\subsection*{Charter}

\textbf{Charter} \emph{(normative)}

This spec defines how lawful Σ kernels compose in serial, parallel, and temporal forms, preserving Σ lawfulness via posted adapters/combinators and monotone contract combination.

\subsection*{Serial Composition}

\textbf{Posted adapter requirement} \emph{(normative)}

For serial composition with K1\textasciicircum{}Σ = (v1, χ1, …) and K2\textasciicircum{}Σ = (v2, χ2, …), any adapter f used to produce the second valuation MUST be posted as part of the record/contract. In particular, if v2 is defined from u and the upstream decision by: v2(u) = f(u, χ1(v1(u), Θ1, β1)), then f MUST be included in posted data so downstream decisions remain records-only.

\textbf{Monotone contract combination} \emph{(normative)}

The composite kernel K2 ∘ K1 is lawful only if (Σ-A1 … Σ-A7) hold for the composite and if the combined contracts (Θ, β, C) are formed via a monotone operator ⊕ (domain-chosen), i.e. tightening in any component must not rely on hidden slack.

\subsection*{Parallel / Product Composition}

\textbf{Posted decision combinator} \emph{(normative)}

For parallel/product composition K1 ⊗ K2, both kernels evaluate and decisions are aggregated via a posted combinator comb: 2 × 2 → 2 (e.g., AND/OR). The choice of comb MUST be posted as part of the record/contract.

\textbf{Monotone floors/budgets} \emph{(normative)}

Floors and budgets for parallel composition MUST be combined monotonically (tightening cannot rely on hidden slack).

\subsection*{Temporal Composition (window → page → book)}

\textbf{Pages and books} \emph{(normative)}

A page is a lawful record κ for one window. A book is an ordered sequence of pages; optionally, pages may be hash-chained. Chaining preserves replay and does not alter decisions.

\subsection*{Composition Invariants}

\textbf{Records-only preserved} \emph{(normative)}

Composition MUST preserve Σ-A2 (records-only): any dependency introduced by composition must be posted.

\textbf{Replay preserved} \emph{(normative)}

Composition MUST preserve reflexive reproducibility and replayability obligations implied by the Σ contract.
